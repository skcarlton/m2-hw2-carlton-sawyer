I initially set up my git repo in the starter files rather than adding starter files to my git repo. I quickly realized my error and tried to delete everything and start over. I guess the original initial commit remained, so that is why there are two initial commits. Also, I did not code any CSS, I hope that is ok. Other than that, I had no issues. I used https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/spacing/ to understand how to add top margin, but any other resource I used was in the assignment or part of our module resources.
